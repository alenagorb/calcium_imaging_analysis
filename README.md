# calcium_imaging_analysis
Brief Description: 
Set of MATLAB functions that extract data from excel files automatically generated by NIS Elements software and visualise and analyse the data.

Data Description:
Input data: an example of the input data is provided in 'ca_imaging_example_data.xlsx' file (the whole data set could not be provided for copyright reasons).
The data table was automatically generated by the NIS Elements software. Many regions of interest (ROIs) (around 20 per condition) were selected, and the changes in the 
intensity of the fluorescent calcium indicator Fluo-4 were recorded using 'Time Measurement' function in the NIS software. The full data is then exported into the excel 
spreadsheet. 

Project Description: 
This project was designed to write a set of functions that can quickly sort through the excel spreadsheet data, extract the relevant information (in this
case the changes in calcium intensities over exactly 5 mins for every ROI), and horizontally concatenate the relevant data, so that every column represents
the changes in intensity over time for an individual ROI.
